# oh-my-agent

## Architecture

- **SSOT**: `.agents/` directory (do not modify directly)
- **Response language**: Follows `language` in `.agents/oma-config.yaml`
- **Skills**: `.agents/skills/` (domain specialists)
- **Workflows**: `.agents/workflows/` (multi-step orchestration)
- **Subagents**: Same-vendor native dispatch via Claude Code Agent tool with `.claude/agents/{name}.md`; cross-vendor fallback via `oma agent:spawn`

## Per-Agent Dispatch

1. Resolve `target_vendor_for_agent` from `.agents/oma-config.yaml`.
2. If `target_vendor_for_agent === current_runtime_vendor`, use the runtime's native subagent path.
3. If vendors differ, or native subagents are unavailable, use `oma agent:spawn` for that agent only.

## Workflows

Execute by naming the workflow in your prompt. Keywords are auto-detected via hooks.

| Workflow | File | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| orchestrate | `orchestrate.md` | Parallel subagents + Review Loop |
| work | `work.md` | Step-by-step with remediation loop |
| ultrawork | `ultrawork.md` | 5-Phase Gate Loop (11 reviews) |
| plan | `plan.md` | PM task breakdown |
| brainstorm | `brainstorm.md` | Design-first ideation |
| review | `review.md` | QA audit |
| debug | `debug.md` | Root cause + minimal fix |
| scm | `scm.md` | SCM + Git operations + Conventional Commits |

To execute: read and follow `.agents/workflows/{name}.md` step by step.

## Auto-Detection

Hooks: `UserPromptSubmit` (keyword detection), `PreToolUse`, `Stop` (persistent mode)
Keywords defined in `.agents/hooks/core/triggers.json` (multi-language).
Persistent workflows (orchestrate, ultrawork, work) block termination until complete.
Deactivate: say "workflow done".

## Rules

1. **Do not modify `.agents/` files** — SSOT protection
2. Workflows execute via keyword detection or explicit naming — never self-initiated
3. Response language follows `.agents/oma-config.yaml`

## Project Rules

Read the relevant file from `.agents/rules/` when working on matching code.

## Project-Specific Rules

### No Memory-Based Claims About Libraries

In this repository, **never rely on memory or inference** when answering questions about library APIs, parameters, behavior, or version history. Always verify first.

**Required workflow before making any factual claim about a third-party library** (e.g., Ultralytics, PyTorch, ONNX, SAHI):

1. Run `WebSearch` against the official docs/GitHub, **or**
2. Read the actual installed library source under `site-packages/` (use `Read`/`Grep`), **or**
3. Fetch the official documentation page directly via `WebFetch`.

**Forbidden phrasings without verification:**
- "I believe X doesn't support Y"
- "As of version N, this parameter was added/removed"
- "This argument has always been called Z"

**Required phrasings when uncertain:**
- "Let me verify this by checking the source / docs."
- Then perform the lookup, then answer with the citation.

When citing findings, include the source URL or the exact file path + line number you read.

This rule overrides any default behavior. Confident-sounding but unverified answers about library internals are treated as bugs.
